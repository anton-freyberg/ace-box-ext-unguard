### Verify access to Dashboard
To access your dashboard, you need it's URL. In order to get it, on your University event, open the `Environments` tab and click on `Open terminal`. This will open a terminal in your VM. In the terminal run the following command:

`kubectl get ingress -A`

This will give you the links to the resources used during this HOT session.

Start by opening the URL containing `dashboard`. It will open the dashboard displayed in the screenshot below from which you will be able to access your Dynatrace environment, the Jenkins instance that manages our pipelines, as well as a Gitea repository that stores all the source code we will be using to run the pipelines.
