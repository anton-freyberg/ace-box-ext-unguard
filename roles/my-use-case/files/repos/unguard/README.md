___

**Unguard** (üá¶üáπ [Àà änÀå…°uÀêat] like disquieting, üá´üá∑ [√£Àà…°ard] like the fencing command) is an **insecure** cloud-native
microservices demo application. It consists of seven app services, a load generator, and two databases. Unguard
encompasses vulnerabilities like SSRF, Command/SQL injection and comes with built-in Jaeger traces. The application is
a web-based Twitter clone where users can:

* register/login
* post text, URLs and images
* view global or personalized timelines
* see ads on the timeline
* view/follow users
* edit your user biography

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Unguard is composed of seven microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over REST.

| [user-profile-service](./src/profile-service)              | Java Spring     | default         | Serves REST API for updating biography information in a H2 database; vulnerable to SQL injection attacks                                    |
| [user-auth-service](./src/user-auth-service)               | Node.js Express | default         | Serves REST API for authenticating users with JWT tokens (vulnerable to JWT key confusion).                                                 |

| [user-simulator](./src/user-simulator)                     | Node.js Element | default         | Creates synthetic user traffic by simulating an Unguard user using a real browser. Acts as a load generator.                                |
| [malicious-load-generator](./src/malicious-load-generator) |                 | default         | Malicious load generator that makes CMD, JNDI, and SQL injections.                                                                          |

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Deployment

See the [Development Guide](./docs/DEV-GUIDE.md) on how to develop Unguard on a local K8S cluster.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) on how to deploy Unguard to your cloud. Currently, the documentation
only covers AWS.

## ‚ú® Features

* **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)/[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)**: The app is designed to run on a local
  Kubernetes cluster, as well as on the cloud with AWS.
* [**Jaeger Tracing**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/): Most services are instrumented using trace interceptors.
* [**Skaffold**](https://skaffold.dev/): Unguard is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
* **Synthetic Load Generation**: The application comes with a deployment that creates traffic using
  the [Element](https://element.flood.io/) browser-based load generation library.
* **[Exploits](./exploit-toolkit/exploits/README.md)**: Different automated attack scenarios like JWT key confusion
  attacks or remote code execution.
* **[Monitoring](./docs/MONACO.md)**: Dynatrace monitoring by
  utilizing [MONACO](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code).

## ‚ûï Additional Deployment Options

* **Falco**: [See these instructions](./docs/FALCO.md)
* **Tracing**: [See these instructions](./docs/TRACING.md)
* **Malicious Load Generator**: [See these instructions](src/malicious-load-generator/README.md)
